------------classes and id Acceptable Values For an ID The only restrictions on
the value of an id are: it must be unique in the document. it must not contain
any space characters. it must contain at least one character. So the value can
be all digits, just one digit, just punctuation characters, include special
characters, whatever. Just no whitespace. So these are valid:
<div id="container">...</div>
<div id="999">...</div>
<div id="#%LV-||">...</div>
<div id="____V">...</div>
<div id="⌘⌥">...</div>
<div id="♥">...</div>
<div id="{}">...</div>
<div id="©">...</div>
<div id="♤₩¤☆€~¥">...</div>

Those are invalid:
<div id=" ">...</div>
This is also invalid, when included in the same document:
<div id="results">...</div>
<div id="results">...</div>

An id value must begin with a letter, which can then be followed only by:
letters (A-Z/a-z) digits (0-9) hyphens ("-") underscores ("_") colons (":")
periods (".") Referring to the first group of examples in the HTML5 section
above, only one is valid:
<div id="container">...</div>
These are also valid:
<div id="sampletext">...</div>
<div id="sample-text">...</div>
<div id="sample_text">...</div>
<div id="sample:text">...</div>
<div id="sample.text">...</div>

Again, if it doesn't start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase), it's not
valid. -- For a Class The rules for classes are essentially the same as for an
id. The difference is that class values do not need to be unique in the
document. Referring to the examples above, although this is not valid in the
same document:
<div id="results">...</div>
<div id="results">...</div>
This is perfectly okay:
<div class="results">...</div>
<div class="results">...</div>
