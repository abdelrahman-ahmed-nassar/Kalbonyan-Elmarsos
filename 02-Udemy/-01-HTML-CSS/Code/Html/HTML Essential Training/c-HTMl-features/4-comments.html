<!--
  in old day all tags were written in uppercase
  It doesn't matter the browser will support whatever you do 

  some elements are short like   p  i  a  
  that because in past that was for saving memory 

  the closing tag 
  The newer HTML elements always have both an opening and a closing tag
  but for some of the older elements, there is no closing tag. Like, image

Inline display elements, usually such as span or a, will include up to one
white-space character before and after them in the document. In order to avoid
very long lines in the markup (that are hard to read) and unintentional
white-space (which affects formatting), the white-space can be commented out.
<!-- Use an HTML comment to nullify the newline character below: -->
<a href="#">I hope there will be no extra whitespace after this!</a
><!--
--><button>Foo</button>
Try it without a comment between the inline elements, and there will be one
space between them. Sometimes picking up the space character is desired. Example
code:
<!-- Use an HTML comment to nullify the newline character below: -->
GoalKicker.com â€“ HTML5 Notes for Professionals 25
<a href="#">I hope there will be no extra whitespace after this!</a
><!--
--><button>Foo</button>
<hr />
<!-- Without it, you can notice a small formatting difference: -->
<a href="#">I hope there will be no extra whitespace after this!</a>
<button>Foo</button>
Output:
