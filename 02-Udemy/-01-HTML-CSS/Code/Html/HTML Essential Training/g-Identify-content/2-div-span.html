element doesn't have semantic meaning but you need them to specify element and
apply style to it
<div id="uniqe" class="exemple_class another-class">
  <!-- an elements container -->
  <p class="another-class">
    this is a paragraph <span>a words container </span>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- 
  div is block level element 
  span is inline level element 
-->
