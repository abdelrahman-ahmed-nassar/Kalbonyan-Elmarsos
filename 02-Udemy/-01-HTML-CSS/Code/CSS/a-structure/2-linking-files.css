/***********  How could you link the css file with the html ************/

/*
----------------[1] with the <link> tag  in html like 

  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="the path of the file" type="text/css">
  </head>

ypu can have more than <link> in the same page and the ine comes last will override the others 

you can link one html file with more than html file 
and you can make more than css file to style one html file

[relative path] => link to some thing to your website  (its in your server or device)

[absolute path]  => refer to a resource located on a foreign server like a link in another web

don't refer to specific file or image by absolute path, instead download it and then call it with the relative path

{ notice that }

<a href="https://notmywebsite.com"> link to external website </a>  OKAY

< img src="https://notmywebsite.com/images/photo.jpg"> link to a specific image or file in a website NOT OKAY  [hot linking you should avoid]


----------------[2] 
<head> 
  <style type="text/css">
    @import url("the css file path");
  </style>
</head>

or you can put this in the CSS file 

@import '/additional-styles.css';

this way you can separate you css styling to more than file and then combine them to one file 
no one use ths way nowadays because it will make your web slow

[notice that]
if you have a lot of css files you can combine them in one file by making it and import the other files in it
