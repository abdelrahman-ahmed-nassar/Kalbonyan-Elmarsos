/*
  [1] absolute <length>

  fixed units, always the same size 
  not affected by value in related elements 
  Example =>
  
  cm__centimeter =>   37.8px  = 25.2/64 in
  mm_Millimeters  =>  1/10th of 1cm 
  in__inches  =>      2.54cm  = 96px
  pc__picas  =>       1/6th of 1in  
  pt__point  =>       1/72th of 1in
  px__pixel =>        1/96th of 1 in   ==>>> the most common 
  
  [2] relative <length> 
  relational sizing, not fixed 
  dependent upon values declared in parent and ancestor elements
  Example => 

  
  percentage => of the container box what ever it is  
  1em   => Font size of the parent (the closest ancestor element ) 1.1em = 110% from the parent size
  1ex   => x-height of the element's font.
  1rem  => Font size of the root element. ==>   [html]  which is 16px
  1vw   => 1% of the viewport's width.
  1vh   => 1% of the viewport's height.
  1vmin => 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
  1vmax =>	1% of the viewport's larger dimension.

  you don't have to put a unit if the value is 0

  notice that 
  there is some elements that come with default style like [h2] for example
