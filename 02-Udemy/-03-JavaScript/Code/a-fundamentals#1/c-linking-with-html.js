/*
external 


<body>

<script src="path.js"></script>
</body>


we put it in the end so the browser read all the DOM then manipulate it with js 
because it can't manipulate it without seeing it 

or inline script 

<head>
  <script> 
  let a = 10;
  </script>
</head>

or in the last of the body 
<body> 
  <script>
  let a = 10;
  </script>

</body>
