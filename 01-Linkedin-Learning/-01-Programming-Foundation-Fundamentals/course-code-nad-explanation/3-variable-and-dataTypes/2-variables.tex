variable is simply a container for a value

the computer gives us space in its memory where we can put data that we want to use as a reference for later.

we make a variable by using the assignment operator [=] to assign a value to a variable that have a name 

although we use an equal sign 
but in programming:
  the equals sign means I want to take the value on the right and store it in the variable on the left. It doesn't mean the two sides are equal.
