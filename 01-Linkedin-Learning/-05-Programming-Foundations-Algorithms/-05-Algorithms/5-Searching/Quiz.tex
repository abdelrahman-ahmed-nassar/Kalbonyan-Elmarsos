1-Given that it is faster to search ordered lists, what is the downside of using them?

answer: They are more time consuming to create and maintain than unordered lists.

2-Why does a test for ordering require an algorithm that is linear in time complexity?

answer: It must test every element.

3-A developer routinely uses code to search an unordered list.
 As more items are added to the list over time, what does the developer notice about efficiency with the search?

answer: The search time is increased relative to the number of items added to the list.

4-A developer decides to sort data rather than search for data.
 If the developer wants to find a specific number, how does the sort find the desired value?

answer: Indexes are created at the beginning and end of the list and a midpoint is calculated.
 Values are searched between the index and midpoint. The indexes move based on the results.

5-Searching in an unordered list requires computational time that is _____ in the list size.

answer: linear
