1-What benefit does a linked list provide?


answer: underlying memory does not need to be contiguous

2-What criteria allows algorithms to execute efficiently?


answer: the scenario and available data structure types

3-In the example linear array, how are the elements referenced using index values? 
1 2 3 4 5 

answer: 0,1,2,3,4

4-Why are hash tables favored over arrays or linked lists?


answer: They are faster for item lookups.

5-Why are linked lists sometimes preferred over arrays?


answer: They are easier and faster to iterate sequentially.

6-According to the code snippet below, which element will be removed from the queue?
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)
queue.append(4)
x = queue.popLeft()

answer: 1

7-Stacks are _____ data structures.


answer: last in, first out

8-How does a hash table map index values to data values?


answer: Keys are mapped to data values by using a hash to compute an index value.

9-Which data structure is most analogous to a dictionary?


answer: a hash table

10-What does the below code do, when working with a linked list?
1 new_node = Node(data)
2 new_node.set_next(self.head)
3 self.head = new_node
4 self.count += 1


answer: It add a new node and makes it the head of the list.

11-Which data structure operation would be used for an “undo” command?


answer: a stack using last-in, first-out

12-How many elements are in an 8 by 3 by 2 array?


answer: 48
