first of all you wil have the same working directory with all branches 

branches are where you commit the changes 


see the branches in the project  
git branch --all 

******* create branch 
git branch the-name-of-branch

***********go to branch 
git checkout branch-name


********* delete a branch 
git branch -d branch-name     safe delete 
git branch -D branch-name  to force delete 

***** create branch and go to it in the same command 
git checkout -b the-name-of-the-branch

**** rename branch 
be in the branch
git branch -m new-name 

***** merge branches 
first way 

be in the master branch 
git merge sub-branch-you-want-to-merge
now you can delete the sub-branch 

***** 
second way 

making branch 
make changes in it 
commit changes 
push directly to the origin without merging by 
  git  origin sub-branch 
then make pull request
  and merge it from github 
now you can delete the sub-branch
