in Python, each item in a list can be of any data type.
 So you could combine strings, numbers, and other types of data like Boolean values, all in the same list. 
But other languages, like C++, require that all values in this type of collection must be of the same data type. 
for instance, containing all strings or all numbers, but no combination of these or other types of data


In Python lists, or Python dictionaries, you can add or remove items, or you can change the value of an existing item.
We refer to these collections as mutable.
meaning they can be changed. 
But some programming languages support collections that are immutable, meaning that their values cannot change after they're created.
In fact, Python itself lets you create a collection known as a tuple, which is essentially an immutable list. 
Once you create a tuple, you can't change it\

what's known as a list in Python is called an array in JavaScript and C++. 
Python dictionaries are known variously as associate arrays, maps, or tables.
