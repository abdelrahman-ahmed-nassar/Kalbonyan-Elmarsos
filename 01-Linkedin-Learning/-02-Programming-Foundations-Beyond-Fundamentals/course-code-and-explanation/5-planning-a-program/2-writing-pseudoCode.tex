Writing pseudo code involves simply writing a description of what you're trying to do using plain language

Pseudo coding helps you create a basic outline of the program you're creating

Pseudo code  frees you from having to decide on a specific syntax to use or even a specific language. Instead, you simply describe what you need to accomplish.

When your pseudo code is done, you're left with an outline for your program, 
which you can then built out using a programming language. 
With the big picture decisions made you're ready at that point to get into the details,
 like language and syntax.
