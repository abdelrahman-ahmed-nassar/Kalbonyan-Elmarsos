In programming
when you'm writing code I need to continue a loop until the program arrives at a certain state.
In Python, you use a while statement to create this type of loop. 


o get started with a while loop we commonly use a variable that will be modified on each iteration through the loop. 
The name doesn't matter, but you'll often see the variable name i, which is short for iterator.

print('Counting to 100 by fives:')
i = 5
while i <= 100:  # mean while that condition is true
    print(i)
    i = i + 5
print('List complete!')
