Heap 
  A data structure implemented as a binary tree 
  where each parent had a maximum of two direct child nodes.

  What make heaps special 
    Constrain
      As we add items to the heap, they are always added top to bottom, left to right.
       We completely fill in the level before moving onto the next. 

    Min heap 
        1
     2     3
    4 5   6 7 
any child must be greater than its parent node
  Max heap 
       7 
    6    5 
  4  3  2  1 
any child must be less than its parent node.
