to make the first release 
first every thing you want to include in the version must be in the remote 

see the tags 
  git tag 

make tag 
  git tag v1.0

pushing the tag to the remote 
git push origin v1.0 

/* make tag with message */
git tag -a v2.0 - "second version"

git push origin v2.0

when pushing new changes 
the commit will be added to all version 

but to solve that you can make a branch for every release

**to search in tags 
git tag -l "v1."

** to make release  
  from github make release and publish it
