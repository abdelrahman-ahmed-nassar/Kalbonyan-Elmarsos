and more description 
but keep each line less less than 72 character

=>      git log 
how to view the commits that have been made to a git 
git log 

that will show every commit 
every commit has a unique id 
and author 
and the date 
and the commit message 
\
and will show you the HEAD

git log -n 5 
show only the most recent five commits 

git log --since=2022-01-01 
every commit happens after this date 

git log --until=2020-01-01 
every thing before that date 

git log --author="any part of the author name" 

git log --grep="any part of the commit message"
=>   sha value
every commit has a unique  Hash  value  called sha value  
with the checksum   which change the commit to id with using SHA_1 algorithm 
the hash   is consist of  40 character 
the first commit has no parent   and called the master branch 
the second commit's father is the first 
every commit inherit the meta data from his parent but he gets a new hash value
______________________________________________________
HEAD 
a pointer to tip of current branch in repository 
last state of repository, what was last checked out 
and point to parent of next commit where writing commits takes place 

point to the last commit we made and its the commit which will be the parent of the next commit 
_____________________________________
              view changes that in the staging area comparing with  the working area

git diff 
git diff 
if you commit the changes then you won't see them  except 

you use  
git diff --staged   or  git diff --cached 

the compare between the staging area and the 

@@  -129,7    the index of the initial line and how many index shown 

when a lot of differences is shown 
space or f     to the next page 
f   going forward
b going backward 

-C     switch between folding or wrapping 

q back to the command line 


git diff --color-words
it  colorize only the changed words 

_____________________________________
        shortcut for commit without add and skipping staging area

git commit -am "commit message "  =  git commit --all

notice 
stages and commits all changes to tracked files so it's going to commit every thing 

does not include untracked file 


______________________________________________________
         show changes that have committed 

git show sha-value   or part of it   6 character


______________________________________________________
                          compare commits 
git diff the_hash of the old..the new 
git diff the_hash of the old..the new --color-words 
git diff the_hash of the old..HEAD --color-words 
Head refers to the last commit 
or the first char from the sha value 
_____________________________________
              multi line commit message 
                          
git commit -a 
git commit 
_____________________________________
                male atomic commit 

small commits 
only affecting a single aspect 
easier to understand, to work with, and to find bugs 
improve collaboration 

_____________________________________
Undo actions 

=>in working area 
git diff  

git checkout --<file>

it discard the changes 
and replace it with whatever we had in our directory
and restores back to the version of the repository 

=> in staging area 

git reset Head <file> 

_________________________________________ 
amending commits that in the repository 

editing previous commit 

git commit --amend -m "the commit message" 

will delete the HEAD commit and combine it with the new one 

but it's sha value will change 
_____________________________________
retrieve old version 


the previous commit  that we want his version 

git check out sha value  --  the file 

that will but that file in the staging area

that will make the file in the ild version the the commit stand on it 

then commit a new commit 
_____________________________________
revert commit 


git revert sha value 

that will make new commit the indicate the last commit that we reverted 

_____________________________________
                 remove untracked files 

git clean -n 
is try 
git clean -f 
do an action and delete the untracked files 

__________________________
                      ignore file

make file called .gitignore 

but inside it  as example :

the name of the file with .log extension
# comment 
project/.gitignore
log/*.txt
*.php 
!.index.php 
.Dc_store 
*.zip
log/*.log 


__________________________
globally ignore 

git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.any file name like  .gitignore_global


ignore tracked files which had committed
may 
git rm the_file 

git rm --cached the file name 

it will add it to the staging area 
and ready for commit 

_____________________________________
track empty directories 

add  a dot file in that file
