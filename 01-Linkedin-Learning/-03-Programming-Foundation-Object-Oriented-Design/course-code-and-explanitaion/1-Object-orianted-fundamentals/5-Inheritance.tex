Inheritance:
  mean making new class from another class 
  the new class will inherit every thing in hte first class 
  and you can add more attributes and methods to the new class
  the first class called the superClass / parent class / base class 
  the new one called the subClass  /  child class / derived class 
  there is no limit to the number of child classes I can create based off of a single parent.
  If you change in a parent it will change in all the child classes 


Multiple Inheritance:
  mean one child has more than father 
  not good and not supported in all the language
