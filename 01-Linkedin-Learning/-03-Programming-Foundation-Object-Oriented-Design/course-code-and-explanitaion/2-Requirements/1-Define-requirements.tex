*******   Gather the requirements  ******

- The first step to any design process is to gather your requirements.
Figure out what your application or product needs to do.

requirements = what does the program need to do ?
what is the problem you are trying to solve ?
why are you building the program in the first place? 


functional requirements:
  what must it do?
  the application must do ......



non-functional requirements:
  how should it do it ?
  the system should be ....
    Legal 
    performance 
    Support 
    security

many developers fall into is having a dozen semi formed ideas about the cool features their app could have, versus nailing down what it really needs to do.

be specific, and write things down.
