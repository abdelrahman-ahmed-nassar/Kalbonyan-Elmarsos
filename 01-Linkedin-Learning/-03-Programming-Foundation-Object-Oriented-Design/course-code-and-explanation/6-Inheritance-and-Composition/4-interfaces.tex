- Interfaces are another common form of abstraction that's supported by many object-oriented languages. 

Interface 
  list of methods for a class to implement. 
  It doesn't contain any actual behavior.
  you're not allowed to put any functionality inside an interface.

  EX:  (java)
    interface Moveable {
      void move (int x, int y)
    }

Interfaces are used to represent a capability that a class implements. Whereas and abstract class represents a type that another class can inherit from.
