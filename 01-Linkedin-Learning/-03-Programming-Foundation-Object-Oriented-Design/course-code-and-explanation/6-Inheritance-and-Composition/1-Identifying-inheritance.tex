- Inheritance is one of the four key concepts of object orientation.
It allows one or more classes to inherit the attributes and methods of another class, referred to as the parent or superclass.
The inheriting subclasses or child classes automatically have all of the attributes and methods of their parent class.
And they can have their own unique attributes and methods in addition to those. 

Inheritance describes an "is a" or "is kind of" relationship between objects.
